# Hello Web App: Intro to web app development using Python and Django

Hi, I'm Tracy! 

Hi, I'm Tracy!

In January 2011, [I taught myself Python and Django and launched my first web app in six weeks](http://www.limedaring.com/im-a-designer-who-learned-django-and-launched-her-first-webapp-in-6-weeks/).

Three years later, this web app has evolved into my startup, [WeddingLovely](http://weddinglovely.com) (a part of [500 Startups](http://500.co) and the [Designer Fund](http://designerfund.com)) - I've designed and built the entire company and LOVE web app development!

Learning to code was so frustrating, especially as a right-brained designer with no back-end programming experience. Tutorials assumed I was comfortable with the command line, knew what a model-view-template architecture was, and already had a grasp on programming tools and resources. 

I want to build a introduction to web app programming using Django and Python which assumes absolutely no programming knowledge - down-to-earth explanations of programming terms and basic walkthroughs of using important programming utilities like git (for version control), GitHub (for backups), virtualenv (for virtual environments), and others. The book will also emphasize templates first - getting to the visual, web-app view first to see results rather than using the command line.

Requirements will be a very basic overview of Python and programming concepts and basic HTML/CSS knowledge, with recommendations for resources to learn those components quickly. The book will be useful with anyone with these requirements, but I'm also especially interested in young coders, women coders, and designers who want to learn how to launch a web app.

The e-book will also be released DRM-free!
