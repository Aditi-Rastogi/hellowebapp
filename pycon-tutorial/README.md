# PyCon tutorial

## Outline

Here's the tentative outline for the course, which is pretty much the exact
outline of the upcoming Hello Web App book. We probably won't cover all topics
but they're here just in case:

* Introductions
* Best practices for planning your web app.
    * MVPs
    * How to narrow down your scope.
    * How launch quickly and why.
* What we're going to build in the tutorial.
    * "Collection of objects"
* Review of pre-requisites and making sure everyone is ready.
    * Very basic knowledge of Python and logic.
        * [Resources to learn](https://github.com/limedaring/HelloWebApp/tree/master/python-tips)
    * Python must already be installed.
        * [Use this guide to install](https://github.com/limedaring/HelloWebApp/tree/master/installation-instructions).
    * Django installed
        * [Guide](https://github.com/limedaring/HelloWebApp/blob/master/installation-instructions/starting-your-project.md)
* Rest of the book!
